# gitIntro
The Carbon_gdp_gini.R and Carbon_gdp_gini.pbix dashboards take data imported from https://ourworldindata.org.
They are intended to be the same dashboard in two different tools.
The raw data is timeseries values for Carbon Footprint per Capita (CF_pc), Gross Domestic Product per Capita (GDP_pc) and Gini Index (GI)  
They have three tabs.
One shows trends from 1980-2020 in CF_pc, GDP_pc and GI for a user selected country. 
The second shows a colour map of correlation coefficients between GDP per capita and carbon_footprint per capita.
The third tab shows an automated ARIMA forecast of for all three quantities for a user specified country and a user specified number of years into the future.
